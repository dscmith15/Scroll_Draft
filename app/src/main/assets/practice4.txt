Historians have found that the creation of the pyramids in Egypt and Mesoamerica are separated by over 2,000 years. The Egyptians used only cut stone found many miles away from the pyramid sites—a construction method that let them build solid buildings that could stand the test of time. On the other hand, the pyramids of Mesoamerica were not built to last. Rather, the step pyramids rose in tiers, on the top of which a small temple was made. Unlike the Egyptians, they used irregular stones. Also, they did not share the same basic design function. While the Egyptian pyramids were private tombs meant to separate the pharaoh’s remains from the mainstream of society and protect him for eternity, the pyramids of Mesoamerica were primarily public temples of ritual and celebration.                                                              .
