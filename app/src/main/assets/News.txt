A Saudi military spokesman said Thursday the kingdom is ready to send ground troops to Syria to fight ISIS â€” an offer welcomed by Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Saudi Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri on Thursday told The Associated Press that Saudi Arabia has taken part in coalition airstrikes against ISIS since the U.S.-led campaign began in September 2014, but could now provide ground troops. The U.S. is scheduled to convene a meeting of defense ministers from countries fighting ISIS in Brussels next week month. "We are determined to fight and defeat Daesh," Asiri said, using the pejorative Arabic term for ISIS. He didn't say how many troops the kingdom would send. Saudi Arabia is deeply involved in Yemen's civil war, where it is fighting Iranian-backed Shiite rebels. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries have long viewed Iran as a regional menace, and Riyadh and Tehran back opposite sides in the wars in Syria and Yemen.
