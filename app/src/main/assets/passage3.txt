White students rioted in protest of her admission, and the federal government had to assume command of the Alabama National Guard in order to protect her. Even so, on her first day in class, Lucy bravely took a seat in the front row. For protection, Lucy was taken in and out of buildings by the back door and driven from class to class by school faculty. The students kept rioting, and one day, the windshield of her car was broken. The university suspended her, saying it was for her own safety. When her lawyer gave a statement in her name protesting her suspension, the university used it as grounds to expel her. Although she never finished her degree, Lucy’s courage inspired African American students who followed her lead.                                                              .
