                                                              O’Connell Street is the main street of Dublin City. Although it is not a very long street, Dubliners will tell visitors that it is the widest street in all of Europe. This claim usually meets with protests that the Champs Elysees in France is wider. But the witty Dubliner will not easily give up bragging rights and will trump the visitor with a fine point: The Champs Elysees is a boulevard; O’Connell is a street. Divided by several key monuments running as long as its center, the street is named for Daniel O’Connell, an Irish patriot. O’Connell stands high above the crowds of shoppers, business people, and students on a sturdy column, surrounded by four angels at each corner of the base. Further up the street is the famous General Post Office that locals call the GPO. During the 1916 rebellion, the GPO was taken over from British rule and occupied by Irish rebels, sparking weeks of armed combat in the city’s center. To this day, the angels of O’Connell’s monument bear the marks of the fighting.                                                              .
