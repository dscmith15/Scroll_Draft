                                                              Saving energy means saving money. Homeowners and renters know this basic fact, but they often don’t know what adjustments they can make in their homes that will save them money. For those willing to spend some time and money to reap long-term energy savings, an energy audit is the way to go. An auditor will pinpoint areas of your home that use the most energy and offer solutions to lower your energy use and costs. Trained energy auditors know what to look for and can locate a variety of flaws that may be resulting in energy inefficiency. There are also quicker and less costly measures that can be taken. One way to save money is to replace incandescent lights with fluorescents. This can result in a savings of more than 50% on your monthly lighting costs. When it’s time to replace old appliances, it’s wise to spend a bit more for an energy-efficient model, and be sure that you are taking advantage of energy-saving settings already on your current refrigerator, dishwasher, washing machine, or dryer. Most areas of your home or apartment offer opportunities to save energy and money. The results are significant and are well worth the effort.                                                              .
