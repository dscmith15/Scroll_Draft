                                                              Often times, people think of genius as having a quality that is not only special, but also eccentric. People see genius as an extraordinary quality, but one that can also be strange. They think of genius as a completely erratic trait. Until recently, psychologists thought of the quirks of genius as too irregular to clearly describe; however, Anna Findleyâ€™s ground breaking study shows that there are obvious patterns in books about the lives of geniuses. These patterns do not get rid of the common belief that there is a kind of magical intervention in the lives of unusually talented men and women, even though they happen with some regularity. Despite this, the research shows that all geniuses seem to have three very productive times in their lives, one of which always happens shortly before their deaths; this is true whether the genius lives to be 19 or as old as 90.                                                              .
