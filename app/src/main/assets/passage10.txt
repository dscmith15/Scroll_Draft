                                                              A pioneer leader for women’s rights, Susan B. Anthony became one of the leading women reformers of the nineteenth century. In Rochester, New York, she began her first public crusade on behalf of temperance. The temperance movement dealt with the abuses of women and children who suffered from alcoholic husbands. Also, she worked tirelessly against slavery and for women’s rights. At the time Anthony lived, women did not have the right to vote. Because she voted in the 1872 election, a U.S. Marshall arrested Anthony. She hoped to prove that women had the legal right to vote under the provisions of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the Constitution. At her trial, a judge found her guilty and fined her $100, which she refused to pay. Anthony collaborated with reformers of women’s rights such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Amelia Bloomer. Susan worked for the American Anti-Slavery Society with Frederick Douglass, a fugitive slave and black abolitionist. On July 2, 1979, the U.S. Mint honored her work by issuing the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin. Although Anthony did not live to see the fruits of her efforts, the establishment of the nineteenth amendment is indebted to her efforts.                                                              .
