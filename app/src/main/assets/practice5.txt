                                                              Kwanzaa is a holiday celebrated by many African Americans from December 26 to January 1. It pays tribute to the rich cultural roots of African Americans, and celebrates family, community, and culture. Kwanzaa means the first fruits of the harvest and is based on the ancient African first-fruit harvest celebrations. The modern holiday of Kwanzaa was founded in 1966 by a professor at the California State University. The holiday is a seven-day celebration. It encourages people to think about their African roots as well as their life in present day America. There are seven main principles on which Kwanzaa is based. These rules include unity, determination, work and responsibility, purpose, creativity, and faith. People celebrate by acting out rituals such as lighting the kinara. Each of the kinaraâ€™s seven candles represents a principle beginning with unity, the black center candle. Talking with family, drumming, singing, and dancing are all part of the celebration as well.                                                              .
